# Roadmap issue ledger

This ledger reserves fixed issuing-area namespaces. Allocate the next work item in its area as one greater than that area's high-water mark; never lower a value or reuse an issued number after a record is pruned. Areas are not mutable themes or groups.

- `FND` reserves through `001`.
- `TOOL` reserves through `002`.
