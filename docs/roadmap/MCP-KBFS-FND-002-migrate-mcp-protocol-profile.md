## Goal

Move mcp-ki-kb-fs to the supported MCP 2026-07-28 server profile without breaking its existing tool surface or legacy clients.

## Context

The Harness KI-HARNESS-GOV-006 rollout now derives protocol applicability from the runtime dependency. This repository still declares @modelcontextprotocol/sdk major 1 and remains conformant to the legacy 2025-11-25 profile. The accepted mcp-git-audit pilot proves the modern package family, per-connection stdio factory, SDK-owned discovery, complete result envelopes, smoke boundary, and deliberate compatibility fallback.

## Boundary

Do not change the public tool contract, remove legacy compatibility without evidence, or treat the Harness rollout as receiver acceptance. This record captures receiver-owned migration work only; prioritisation, implementation, verification, acceptance, release, and publication remain in this repository.

## Shaping

Adopt the accepted pilot as the first comparison baseline: move to the v2 server package family, replace the legacy stdio transport with a per-connection serveStdio factory, add resultType: "complete" to synchronous result helpers, retain deliberate legacy fallback, and prove SDK-owned discovery through the repository smoke boundary.

Promote to Next when the exact dependency delta, entry-point change, compatibility boundary, and receiver-specific smoke assertions are reviewed against this repository's current source.

## Discussion

### Source evidence

The portable profile and rubric live in ki-repo-mcp; the accepted mcp-git-audit migration is implementation evidence, not a patch to copy mechanically. Receiver-specific authentication, configuration, generated client, and tool-envelope differences remain local design inputs.

### Acceptance boundary

The modern profile is not claimed until this repository's package, result helpers, stdio entry point, focused tests, live smoke, and ki-repo-mcp audit agree. A passing legacy audit before migration remains expected.
