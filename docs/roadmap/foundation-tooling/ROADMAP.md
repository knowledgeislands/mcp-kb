# Foundation tooling roadmap

## Blocking

Actively broken, or blocking the `Next` horizon: takes priority over everything else and must clear before `Next` work proceeds. Empty means nothing is on fire.

## Next

Scoped and ready to start — the immediate queue, picked up before anything in **Soon** or **Future**.

## Soon

Understood and roughly scoped but not yet started — worth doing once the **Next** queue clears, ahead of anything still speculative.

### Add wire-level smoke test

Smoke test (`bun run ki:test:smoke`) — boot the built server and verify the wire-level tool surface matches in-process registration. mcp-gmail has the reference implementation (`scripts/smoke.ts` + CI step); kb-fs lacks both.

## Waiting for

Worth doing, but presently blocked on an external dependency or decision. Revisit when its named condition changes rather than treating it as dormant local work.

## Future

Speculative or not yet scoped — items marked _(candidate)_ need a scoping pass (or a decision to drop them) before they're actionable.
